  "mission_description": "We are crazy crypto enthusiasts who simplify complex things in the crypto industry to the level of understanding “so that even a grandmother would understand” and always ask the question “what if?”. We see existing solutions and look for where to apply them. We brave creatives and for us crypto is an art: we try, test, share experience, make mistakes, fall, get up, win and move on! We make mistakes faster to save you from them! We saw content that you want to watch. Support projects in who believe and who believe in us! We are fervent guys who ambitiously develop the industry without investors. We are driven by the community, and we charge it.",
